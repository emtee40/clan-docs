Our vision in this context, is how we think the final product should behave and how users will interact with it. cLAN aims to provide an alternative to the ever-increasing centralization of the internet.

Rather than relying on a centralized cloud, accessible through the clearnet, our goal is to establish an encrypted network of interconnected computers, forming a decentralized darknetâ€”a user-driven cloud known as a cLAN.

Our vision includes providing users with a seamless experience when joining one or multiple cLANs through invitation links. Clicking the link will trigger a popup that seeks confirmation to connect to the network.

During the joining process, the user's computer (referred to as the client hereafter) will download a file containing information about a virtual machine (VM). The client will then automatically initiate the VM setup, and upon completion, this VM will become part of the cLAN.

Once connected, users will gain access to a dashboard showcasing all the services offered within this particular cLAN. Within this dashboard, users can easily add applications or choose to host services for other cLAN members, such as a Nextcloud instance or other services.
